Program Description:
                For a given logic building program we would be print the output in the form of string. 
                
                prototype: String(String input1)  //method to call
                
               rules:
                     1. If the input String length is exceed 10, then output would be
                     Example:
                            input1: Entertainment
                            output: E11t          // because String length greater than 10.
                      2. otherwise,
                      Example:
                            input1: Java
                            output: Java
